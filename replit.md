# Fortune Signals - Casino Game Signal Generator

## Overview

Fortune Signals is a full-stack web application that generates predictive signals for casino games, specifically Fortune-themed games like Fortune Rabbit and Fortune Tiger. The application features a modern casino-themed UI with real-time signal generation, statistics tracking, and a responsive design.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom casino theme
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui components
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Storage**: In-memory storage with interface for database abstraction
- **API**: RESTful API with JSON responses

### Build System
- **Development**: Vite dev server with HMR
- **Production**: esbuild for server bundling, Vite for client bundling
- **TypeScript**: Shared types between client and server

## Key Components

### Database Schema
- **Games Table**: Stores game information (name, display name, emoji, badges)
- **Signals Table**: Stores generated signals with strength levels, confidence scores, and results
- **Relationships**: Signals reference games via foreign key

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/games` - Retrieve all available games
- `GET /api/games/:id` - Get specific game details
- `POST /api/signals` - Generate new signal
- `GET /api/signals/game/:gameId` - Get signals for specific game
- `GET /api/signals/recent` - Get recent signals across all games
- `GET /api/signals/stats` - Get win/loss statistics

### Frontend Pages
- **Home**: Game selection and signal generation interface
- **Signal Generator**: Real-time signal display with statistics and history

### Signal Generation Logic
- Strength levels: FRACO (1), MÃ‰DIO (2), FORTE (3), MUITO FORTE (4)
- Confidence scoring: 1-100 scale
- Result tracking: WIN/LOSS/PENDING states
- Timer-based generation with countdown display

## Data Flow

1. **Game Selection**: User selects a Fortune game from the home page
2. **Signal Generation**: Backend generates random signals with weighted probabilities
3. **Real-time Updates**: Frontend polls for new signals and statistics
4. **Result Tracking**: Signals can be updated with WIN/LOSS results
5. **Statistics Display**: Win rates and performance metrics are calculated and displayed
